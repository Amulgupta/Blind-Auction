# Blind-Auction
This python project demonstrates the blind auction for an object where the highest bidder wins.  It gives a more realistic feeling with replit as it has "clear()" function which clears the screen after every bid, which the python IDLE doesn't support.
Although commenting out import replit and clear() will make the code run in python IDLE as well.
